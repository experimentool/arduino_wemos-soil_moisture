This project measures soil moisture with a capacitive probe and reports that information along with soil temperature and the 3.3V bus voltage in a wireless configuration.  It uses 2 Wemos esp8266 boards utilizing wifi communication without a router.  The Wemos Station board includes the capacitive moisture and ds18b20 temperature probes and a ADS1115 ADC for measuring the 3.3V bus.  This Station is powered from one 18650 lipo and is charged photovoltaically. It transmits the data then goes into deep sleep for 30 minutes in a repeating sequence. The Access Point receiver utilizes an oled for display. It is powered continuously and with a common 5V power charger.  Refer to the comments in the Station and Access Point coding for further information.
